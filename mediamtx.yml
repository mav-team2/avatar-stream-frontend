## MediaMTX configuration
## Enable protocols needed: RTSP ingest, HLS output, plus existing RTMP/WebRTC if desired.
rtsp: yes # (default yes, explicit for clarity)
rtmp: yes # keep RTMP if still needed
webrtc: yes # keep WebRTC if needed
hls: yes # enable HLS muxing (served on port 8888)
logLevel: info # 필요 시 debug
hlsVariant: mpegts # LL-HLS 경고 회피
hlsSegmentDuration: 2s # 세그먼트 길이

## Optional: force remuxing so HLS is generated for every path as soon as there's a publisher
# hlsAlwaysRemux: yes

paths:
  ## Generic pattern: allow publishers to create any path (including via RTSP push)
  # all:
  ## Uncomment below if you want to allow only publishing (no pulling from elsewhere)
  ## source: publisher

  ## Example of pulling (ingesting) from an external RTSP camera and converting to HLS automatically:
  # camera1:
  #   source: rtsp://your-camera-ip:554/stream
  #   sourceOnDemand: no
  # After starting, HLS playlist will be at: http://<host>:8888/camera1/index.m3u8

  ## Example manual publishing path (ffmpeg pushing via RTSP):
  mystream:
    source: publisher
    ## Access HLS at: http://<host>:8888/mystream/index.m3u8
